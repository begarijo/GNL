# GNL

This project is about read a file descriptor , and return it _line by line_.

To start the GNL, you must know what a **static variable** is, why it's needed, and how it works.

Also, for BUFFER_SIZE, it may or may not give you any buffer size, so it's important to create
a variable in the *.h that controls this.

It's important to read line by line, in spite of buffer size. It'll help the function to work easily and
faster.
